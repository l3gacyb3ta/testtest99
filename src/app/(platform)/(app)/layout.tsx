/**
 * Everything a participant sees: the trail, their projects, the shop, the
 * Doomscroller and the reference pages, all inside the one shell.
 *
 * The group exists to draw the line at the shell rather than at the design
 * system. `/login` wants the tokens and none of the chrome, and a reviewer
 * working through a queue wants neither the trail's sidebar nor a store
 * describing a programme they are not enrolled in.
 *
 * The session gate lives here, in a server component, and is the real one —
 * the cookie check in `proxy.ts` only decides which page to render at `/`.
 * Gating client-side would render the trail first and then take it away.
 *
 * It is also where the trail's data enters the app. Loading it in the layout
 * rather than per page means one read serves every route under it, and a
 * `router.refresh()` after a write reloads all of them at once.
