/**
 * The comp's hand-drawn edges.

 * Every outline in the Figma file — card borders, the rules between nav items,
 * the hairline down the page — is a wobbly ink stroke rather than a clean
 * rectangle. Reproducing that as exported artwork would mean a fixed-size
 * image per card, and the cards are fluid, so the corners would stretch.
 *
 * Instead the wobble is generated: an SVG rectangle whose stroke is pushed
 * around by a turbulence displacement map. That scales to any size, stays
 * crisp at any zoom, costs one filter definition for the whole page, and can
 * be varied per card with `seed` so two cards side by side are not identical
 * tracings of each other — which is what gives a hand-drawn look its life.
 *
 * The filter is applied to the BORDER ELEMENT ONLY, never to a container.
 * Filtering an element that holds text drags the text through the same
 * displacement and turns it to mush.
