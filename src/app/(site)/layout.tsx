 * Open Sans is variable and covers it.

IMPECCABLE DIRECTION CONTRACT

THESIS: Half Life is a ten-week production line for hardware, so the page is
drawn as the line itself — a thick schematic band that physically links each
stage to the next. It refuses the stacked equal-cards "how it works" row that
every program page ships.

OWN-WORLD: Palette is the Figma "color scheme" frame verbatim — ink #31222c
ground, paper #ededed panels, cyan #8ed3dc traces, deep blue #397cbe hero
block, periwinkle #a39bd6 and lavender #c9c7ec bands. Masterpiece brush on the
wordmark, Ubuntu display and tagline, Open Sans body. Square corners, no shadows: flat plates and thick
tapering vector bands, like control-panel silkscreen.

STORY: A 13-18 year old sees the offer and the prize in one viewport, drops an
email, then follows the band down through design -> funding -> build -> printer,
picking up the asides on the way, and leaves believing this is real and free.

FIRST VIEWPORT: Full-bleed illustrated plant-room art under an ink wash; a deep
blue plate holds the wordmark, the ten-week promise, and one paper email field
with a cyan submit. Bottom-left, a hand-angled "here's what you'll make!" over
a scatter of project photos. The "how does it work?" plate breaks the fold.

FORM: Reproduction of the user's approved comp (Figma 275:8) — brief-pinned, so
no concept roll was dealt. seed: brief-pinned/figma-275-8.

FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the finish review, the verdict, and DESIGN.md
