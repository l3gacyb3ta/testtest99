 * The box the artwork is laid into — the file's own aspect, read off the file.
 *
 * It used to be a hardcoded 1125/787, measured off a logo.svg whose ink sat in
 * a 1280-square canvas, with `object-cover` trimming the transparent air back
 * off. That worked exactly as long as the file did not change. The replacement
 * was a 3000-square png whose ink ran y 381–2225 — sitting high, 381 of padding
 * above against 774 below — and `cover` centres its crop, so it opened its
 * window at y 451 and sheared 70px off the top of the wordmark while leaving
 * 324px of slack unused underneath.
 *
 * Two hardcoded numbers are gone instead of being corrected. The file was
 * trimmed to its own ink, so its dimensions now *are* the artwork, and the box
 * takes its ratio from the import rather than from anything typed here. A
 * replacement logo of any shape gets a box of that shape.
