/**
 * The corner decals, placed by their ink rather than by their frames.
 *
 * All five files are 1000x1000 with a wide, uneven transparent margin, and the
 * unevenness is the whole reason this table exists: the right-hand margin runs
 * 15.4% of the file on `bottomrightcorner` and 3.9% on `bottomrightcorner2`.
 * Dropped flush to a plate's corners, the two would sit a quarter of a decal
 * apart from each other, and neither would be at the corner. So `pad` is the
 * alpha bounding box's distance from each edge as a fraction of the file, and
 * it is what the placement below aligns — the drawing lands on the corner, and
 * where the file's edge falls is arithmetic nobody has to look at.
 *
 * `inkW` does the same job for size. The five drawings fill their files
 * differently — 746 units of ink across on one, 630 on another — so a shared
 * render size would draw them at visibly different weights. Normalising on the
 * ink instead means `INK` below is a promise about the drawing, not about the
 * file it arrived in.
 *
 * These numbers are measured out of the committed files' alpha channel, not
 * estimated. Replacing a file means re-measuring its row; the alternative was
 * committing five trimmed derivatives, and `globals.css` already records what
 * that costs — twice — in the note on `tile.png`.
 *
 * `corner` is not a placement choice, it is what each file is drawn for, which
 * its own name states. There is no `toprightcorner` in the set, so no box can
 * be wrapped on all four, and nothing here pretends otherwise.

 * 555-wide aside, which is the same mark at two scales rather than one mark

 * rather than painting it out. A decal is an ornament on the box, so the box
 * has to survive it.
 *
 * It tracks the plates, so it moves when they do — this was 6px when they were

/**
 * How strongly the decals print.
 *
 * Derived, not chosen. These plates are full — the asides carry 160 characters
 * of wrapped body copy and the header plate is one display word across 84% of
 * its width — so at any size a decal reads as, text overprints it. Measured
 * against the darkest fully-opaque pixel in the set, rgb(63,73,38), the two
 * text-on-plate pairs give two ceilings for 4.5:1:
 *
 *   ink #31222c on lavender-pale   0.55
 *   indigo #34316c on lavender     0.30   <- the asides, and the binding one
 *
 * 0.30 is the stricter, so it is the one the whole set takes: one weight
 * across seven plates beats two, and it holds in both layouts however the copy
 * wraps. At it the worst overprint is 4.57:1.
 *
 * Shrinking them instead does not work, and it is worth writing down why. The
 * decal is a share of the plate's width while the flow layout's padding is a
 * flat 20px — 3% of a 672px plate — so any decal big enough to see crosses the
 * padding and lands on the text anyway. Screening back is the only lever that
 * scales.
 *
 * It also lands them in the page's own register. The section grounds print at
 * 0.10, 0.12 and 0.18, so at 0.30 these are the loudest texture here by some
 * margin and still texture rather than content — and the green, which is a
 * hue this palette does not otherwise have, arrives screened rather than raw.

 *
 * The offsets are a `translate`, not part of the `left`/`top` values, and that
 * is the one trick here. Percentages in `translate` resolve against the
 * element's own box, which is exactly what a `pad` fraction is measured
 * against — so the correction is written once, in the units it was measured
 * in, and needs no `calc` and no knowledge of how big the plate is. Doing it
 * through `top` would resolve the vertical share against the plate's *height*
 * and skew every decal by the plate's aspect ratio.
 *
