 * The Doomscroller's rows.
 *
 * Fetched from the client rather than handed down from a server component,
 * because this is the one surface on the platform that is genuinely endless:
 * it pages as you scroll, and the rail and the full-page view want the same
 * rows without one of them re-rendering a layout to get them.
 *
 * Announcements come back as their own list rather than spliced in. Paginating
 * one cursor across two orderings is how a feed starts skipping rows, so the
 * server keeps them apart and they are simply put first here.
