 * The header plate — "how does it work?".

 * comp unit was a different number of pixels in each, and the band that drops
 * out of the header had to cross between them: it reached 179 of its own units
 * below the hero's block while its landing plate had moved to 112px below the
 * top of this one. Under about 1333px of viewport the arithmetic happened to
 * clear. Above it the band ran through "spend 5 weeks designing 5 projects",
 * in the plates' own colour, over the top of it — one drawing in two grids.
 *
 * The header is a part of this drawing, so it is a plate in this stage now, on
 * one grid at one cap with the four plates it introduces. Its `918` is the
 * comp's own, which is also the proportion the comp drew: narrower than step
 * 1's 975, where uncapped it had grown to 1.38x the plate it introduces.
 *

/**
 * Which corner each plate's decal goes in — PARKED, not yet applied.
 *
 * The placements below are commented out at their sites. This is the analysis
 * they were derived from, kept so it does not have to be redone: the corner
 * clearances, the one plate with only a single legal corner, and the reason
 * the decals have to print under the content rather than over it.
 *
 * The rule is that a decal sits on a plate and never on a joint, so the
 * choice is made against the bands rather than by taste. Measuring each
 * corner's distance to the nearest band, at the y where that band actually
 * crosses the plate's edge, rules three of them out: step 2's top-left (72
 * comp units of clearance) and bottom-left (83), and step 4's top-left (66).
 * A decal's ink runs 12% of its plate — 99 units on step 2, 113 on step 4 —
 * so all three would land on the weld. Step 3's top-right is tight too, at
 * 72, and moot: the set has no top-right decal to put there.
 *
 * That leaves step 2 with exactly one corner, bottom-right, and step 4 with
 * two. Everything else is clear by 130 units or more, and the asides are
 * clear on all four — no band comes within 200 units of either.
 *
 * Given those constraints the order is chosen so no two marks down the
 * section repeat and no two land on the same corner:
 *
 *   header plate   top-left        (in Hero, with the plate)
 *   step 1         bottom-left     the band leaves the opposite corner
 *   step 2         bottom-right    forced — both left corners are welds
 *   step 3         top-left 2
 *   aside, viral   bottom-right 2
 *   step 4         bottom-left     its top-left is under the last band
 *   aside, community  top-left
 *
 * Both layouts carry the same seven, so the stacked page is the same drawing
 * and not a reduction of it. The flow layout's own welds are siblings rather
 * than overlays, so nothing is ruled out down there — the assignment is the
 * stage's, kept for consistency rather than recomputed.
 *
 * The other constraint, and the one that decided the treatment: these plates
 * are full, so text overprints a decal wherever one is big enough to read.
 * Measured against the darkest opaque pixel in the set, rgb(63,73,38), AA
 * holds up to 0.55 opacity for ink on lavender-pale and only 0.30 for the
 * asides' indigo on lavender — so 0.30 is what `corner-decal.tsx` prints at,
 * and the decals sit under the content, not over it. Shrinking them instead
 * does not work: the decal is a share of the plate's width while the flow
 * layout's padding is a flat 20px, so anything visible crosses it anyway.

 *
 * Everything in the stage is a comp pixel expressed in `cqw`, so every length
 * in here is a share of the stage's own width. That includes the height: 2706
 * comp units is 156.60cqw, which means widening the window made the section
 * taller, 1:1.57. From 1180 to 1728 that added 858px of scroll — a page
 * getting longer as it gets more room, which is backwards.
 *
 * `.stage` caps at 1728, so the section was constant above that and variable
 * below it; the whole problem lived in the one band between the breakpoint and
 * the cap. Capping here at the breakpoint itself removes the band: the stage is
 * 1180 wide at 1180 and 1180 wide at 3840, so the height is a flat 1848px at
 * every width this layout is ever shown at — which it now actually is; see the
 * stage element below for the `cqw` fallback that was defeating this cap.
 *
 * Nothing is smaller than it already was, which is the part worth being clear
 * about: 1180 was always the narrowest this layout renders at, so the type now
 * sits everywhere at the size a 1180 screen has always shown it — the week
 * labels at 13.7px, the step titles at 27.3px. The composition simply stops
 * growing rather than shrinking. The section's ground and its wave stay
 * full-bleed; only the plates are held to a centred column.
 *
 * Raising this trades exactness for scale. Any value above 1180 re-opens a
 * band between the two where the height moves again — 1280 gives 16px week
 * labels and 151px of travel, 1400 gives 16.2px and 331px.

 * nothing is screened, blended or thrown away: the comp's boxes were refitted
 * to the artwork's own proportions instead. `getfunding.png` is 3.133:1 into a
 * slot the comp drew at 4.748:1, `build.png` is 2.242:1 into one drawn at
 * 2.736:1, and `prizes.png` is 2.863:1 into that same 2.736:1 — so every box
 * took its picture's shape and the plates below moved to make room. Step 4 is
 * the only one that moved *up*: its picture is wider than the slot the comp
 * drew, so the plate lost 12 units rather than gaining them, and being the
 * last plate it took the section's height down with it.
 *
 * `cover` rather than `contain` after all that, and only because the refitted
 * boxes are whole comp units: 736x235 is 3.1319:1 against the file's 3.1333:1.
 * Cover answers that 0.05% with 0.05% of the picture; contain would answer it
 * with a hairline of bare plate down one edge, which is the visible one.

            sr-only, and that is the one thing that made this step read as a
            different object from the three below it: they say what you do and
            then show it, and this one only showed. The plate is
            `STEP_ONE_GROWTH` taller so the title can sit where theirs do — top
            of the plate, 40 units, on the plate's own ground — and the picture
            keeps every unit of width it had.

            The title is centred where the other three are ranged left, and
            that is the picture's doing rather than a whim: the five pairings
            are hand-placed across the full 975 with no left edge to range
            against, so a left-ranged line would hang off a composition that
            has no margin. The box is still the family's 68 gutter, taken on
            both sides — 68 + 839/2 lands on 487.5, the plate's own centre — so
            the line is centred by the box rather than by an offset that has to
            be re-derived if the copy changes. 38 from the top is step 2's.

            The picture starts at 92 instead of the family's ~109 because it
            brings 30 units of its own transparent margin with it, so first ink
            lands 40 below the title either way.

            The five weeks stay in the document under it. A picture that
            replaces text has to hand that text back or the page has quietly
            lost it, and `WeekList` carries the subjects and their numbers. */}

 * the last one's entry and the line down the column is continuous.

 * band used to carry: `lavender-pale` is what the plates either side of it
 * are, so the band reads as the material running on between them.
 *
 * The box is wider than it is tall by the same ratio at both sizes, which puts
 * the run at 51-53° — inside the 49-71° the stage's four bands sit at, and the
 * reason the ends are near the middle of the column rather than at its edges:
