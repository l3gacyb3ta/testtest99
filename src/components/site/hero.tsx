/**
 * The hero plate, taken to half the grid.
 *
 * The comp draws it 1256 wide — 73% of the 1728 grid — which read too heavy
 * against the painting behind it: bg.png is framed on both edges and left open
 * through the middle, and a plate that wide spanned frame to frame and closed
 * the opening. At 864 it is half the grid, and since the stage is the viewport
 * up to its 1728 cap, that is literally 50vw at every width the comp layout
 * runs at.
 *
 * Once it is half the grid it is centred on the grid rather than left where the
 * comp's wider plate started, and that is the relationship bg.png was painted
 * for: the picture carries a pipe column down each edge and is left open
 * through the middle, so a centred plate sits in the opening and leaves both
 * columns to read. `.stage` and the art layer both cap at 1728 and centre, so
 * centring on the grid centres the plate over the painting's own centre at
 * every width. Vertically it keeps the comp's y — the caption and group shot
 * hold the lower left, so there is no free height to centre into.
 *
 * Everything set on the plate scales by the same factor and moves with it, so
 * the comp's internal composition survives intact at a smaller size rather
 * than being re-fitted by hand: offsets are still measured from the comp's own
 * plate origin, and only where that origin lands has changed. Every number
 * below is still the literal Figma pixel DESIGN.md says it is.

 * tiled pattern, and an opaque scrim would paint the texture out again
 * exactly where the dissolve is supposed to be revealing it. Masking the
 * picture instead takes the painting to nothing and lets whatever the room is
 * standing on come up through it, so the pattern arrives as the painting
 * leaves — one handoff instead of two.
 *
 * The stops are `1 - smoothstep(t)` sampled every eighth over the run, not a
 * straight line. A linear ramp is the severe one: alpha is continuous but its
 * slope is not, so the eye finds the kink where the fade starts and the kink
 * where it stops, and reads them as two edges drawn across the picture.
 * Smoothstep leaves 1 and arrives at 0 with zero slope, so neither end has a
 * position to find. The run is the bottom 28% against the old 22% — longer,
 * but the first quarter of it is still above 94% opacity, so the fox in the
 * lower-left corner keeps roughly the exposure it had and only the last

 * — see `PLATE_SIZE` below, which holds the column at the comp's half-grid so
 * that shrinking the mark does not drag the tagline and the form in with it.
 *
 * What the number buys, since the file carries its own inset: the ink is 1125
 * of a 1280 canvas and the box crops nothing horizontally, so the visible mark
 * is 88% of the box — 532 units. Height follows at 0.7 to 1, so it stands 423.
 *
 * Worth knowing before this moves again. 532 of ink sits *under* the 585
 * tagline and the 596 form beneath it, so the mark is no longer the widest
 * thing in the column; it still leads on mass, standing 423 tall against a
 * 22px line, but the three widths are now close enough to read as an
 * near-miss rather than a decision. The two clean stops either side are
 * `u(678)`, where the ink lands on the form's own 596 and the group shares one
 * edge, and `u(PLATE_W)`, where it spans the column outright.
 *
 * The fold has room to spare: 423 for the mark, 172 for the copy and form, 90
 * for the cue — 685 against a 16:9 fold's 972, so anything squarer than 2.5:1

 * and is now the value the box is built from: `swashBoxWidth` takes the line
 * as the middle 75% of the box, which is the inset the swash behind it needs.
 *
 * The line is `whitespace-nowrap`, so a face whose advances run wider than

 *
 * At 1107 the box is wider than the 864 plate it sits on and overhangs it by

          is never shorter than the fold, so the header below is never dragged
          up into view.

          A plain viewport again, and the dateline is why it can be. Standing
          above this block in flow it pushed the fold down by its own height
          and took the scroll cue off the screen with it, so the number here
          had to subtract it back; laid on the painting it costs the fold
          nothing and this is the comp's own arithmetic once more.

          Three rows, 1fr / auto / 1fr, rather than a centred plate with the
          cue absolutely positioned: equal outer rows still centre the plate,
          but the cue is in flow, so on a short wide window the two cannot land
          on top of each other.

          The first row carries a floor, which is the same argument run
          upwards. Centring is a share of the free height, so on a short
          enough window the plate rises to meet the dateline laid on the
          painting — at this stage's cap that starts below about 730px of
          viewport, which is a half-height window rather than a screen, but it
          is reachable. 4.125rem is the plate's bottom edge at `md` and up
          (12px of `top-3` plus its own 42) with 12px of clearance. Above that
          height `1fr` wins in both rows and the centring is untouched; below
          it the plate stops descending on the dateline and the squeeze goes
          to the cue's row, which is the row that was already growing. */}

              25.301em wide, so its size and its length are the same number and
              only one of them is free. At `u(32.8)` the line runs 830 units
              inside the 864 column, leaving 17 either side — enough that the
              metric-adjusted fallback face can miss Ubuntu's advances by 3.9%
              before anything touches the edge.

              It has to be a stage unit rather than a fixed px, which is what
              was actually causing the wrap: at a flat 2rem the sentence needed
              810px of a box that is only 428px at a 1280 window, because the
              box scaled with the stage and the type did not. In `cqw` the two
              move together, so the ratio holds at every width this layout runs
              at — and at the stage's 1728 cap it lands on 32.8px, which is
              where the 2rem was aiming.

              No `width`, no `text-balance`: with one line there is nothing to
              balance, and an explicit measure narrower than the line would only
              give the text something to overflow. As a centred flex item it

              27-unit gap the comp put under the wordmark moves to the box; the
              49 that used to separate the line from the field is gone, since
              the point of grouping them is that they no longer need it. */}
          {/* No width. The comp's 866 was the field's own measure, and once
              the tagline moved inside the box that width became the box's too
              — 596 comp px of box for a line that needs 830, so a nowrap
              sentence hung 269 out of both sides of the teal.

              Sized by its content instead: the plate is a flex column with
              `items-center`, so with no width the box shrinks to its widest
              child and is centred by the same rule that centres everything
              else on the plate. That child is the tagline, which lands the box
              on 865 against the plate's own 864 — the comp's column, arrived
              at rather than typed. The field spans the box under it.

              It is also the more robust way round: the box can no longer clip
              the line, because the line is what sets the box. The 17 units of
              slack the comp left either side were there to absorb a fallback
              face missing Ubuntu's advances by up to 3.9%; now a wider face

 * Cyan used to carry the hover and the focus. That was already the second
 * attempt — the arrow's original classes asked for cyan at rest, and both
 * paths carried a hardcoded `stroke="white"`, so no `color` ever reached the
 * glyph and neither did the hover; moving cyan to the interaction state was
 * the fix. On the steel ground it does not survive there either. Cyan is
 * 4.60:1 on bare steel, 4.27:1 over one arc of the ground pattern and 3.97:1
 * where two cross, and this word is 12.8-16px, so it owes 4.5:1 in every
 * state. Nothing in the palette between cyan and paper clears it: on the
 * worst ground only paper, lavender-pale, blue-pale and white do.
 *
 * So the cyan moved off the text and onto a rule under it. The word holds at
 * 5.70:1 whatever the arcs are doing, the interaction is still signalled in
 * the page's own interaction colour, and an underline is non-text — it owes
 * 3:1 and has 3.97:1. Focus is left to the global `:focus-visible` ring,

          over the word "scroll" would have been the natural move and would
          have failed WCAG 2.5.3, which asks the two to agree.

/**
 * The Hack Club flag, hung from the top-left corner.

 * Flush to the corner rather than inset: the artwork is drawn as a banner
 * running off its own left edge, so any gap reads as a mistake rather than as
 * margin. It scales between 104 and 160px — small enough to stay a mark on the
 * painting rather than a second piece of art competing with it.
 *
 * `absolute`, not `fixed`. The fixed treatment is the more familiar one, but
 * this page scrolls through four rooms with their own grounds and a flag
 * riding over the carousel and the FAQ would be an overlay rather than a
 * corner. It belongs to the hero, so it is positioned in the hero.
 *
 * A link, because that is what the flag is — the mark that says who made this,
 * and it is the only thing on the page that says so above the fold. `alt` does
 * the naming: the image is the link's whole content, so an empty one would
 * leave it with no accessible name at all.

/**
 * One painted scene across the top of the hero, shown whole.
 *
 * bg.png is 1920x1080 and it is composed, not tileable: piping and foliage
 * frame its left and right edges, the fox sits in its lower-left corner, and
 * the middle is left open for the hero plate to land in. It was previously
 * drawn as two half-width tiles with the right one mirrored, which put the fox
 * and the framing on the page twice and — because a 16:9 painting cannot cover
 * a half-width, full-height box without losing about 55% of its width — cropped
 * off the frame that is the whole point of the picture.
 *
 * So the art layer takes the painting's aspect ratio rather than the section's:
 * full width, top-aligned, nothing cropped and nothing repeated. The box is cut
 * to 1920/1080, so `object-cover` has nothing to crop and cannot leave a
 * hairline of bare ink the way `object-contain` would under sub-pixel rounding.
 * Below the picture, and up through its dissolve, is the steel ground and the
 * tiled pattern that the hero and the process section share from one box in
 * `page.tsx` — so the painting resolves into the room it hands off to rather
 * than into a flat field that the room's texture then switches on in further
 * down. The fade is the only place that ground is ever seen arriving, which is
 * why it cannot start at the section below.
 *
 * It spans the screen at every width. Capped at the comp's 1728 it left ink
 * shoulders on anything wider, and the painting is the hero's ground rather
 * than an object standing on it.
 *
 * `max-height: 100%` is the guard that buys. Uncapped, a 16:9 box on a wide
 * screen grows taller than the section it sits in -- a 2560 window only 800
 * tall wants 1440 of painting against 1018 of section -- and `overflow-hidden`
 * would take the difference off the bottom as a hard cut, dissolve and all.
 * Clamped to the section instead, the box stops being 16:9 and `object-cover`
 * trims the picture rather than the layer, so the fade still lands on the
 * bottom edge that is actually visible. Below that width nothing is cropped at
 * all: the box is the painting's own ratio and cover has nothing to take.

            Size and repeat are pinned for the same reason the ground patterns
            pin theirs: a gradient has no intrinsic dimensions, so it is drawn

            on silently. `-webkit-` alongside, for Safari before 15.4. */}
