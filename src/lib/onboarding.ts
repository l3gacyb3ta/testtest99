 * Two rules hold everything together:
 *
 * 1. `onboardingStep` is the furthest step REACHED, never the step being
 *    displayed. Answering step 3 again after reaching step 5 edits the answer
 *    and leaves the progress alone, so a participant can go back and change
 *    their project name without being walked through the tier question again.
 * 2. Nothing here writes `ThemeProject.tier`. The participant's choice lands
 *    in `requestedTier`; the reviewer's decision at design approval is a
 *    different column, and money is paid against theirs.
