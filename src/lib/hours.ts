 *
 * The middle band is sized by the PRINTER, not by the tier. That is the whole
 * shape of the economy: a tier decides how many hours the project itself eats,
 * and the machine on the wall decides how many have to bank on top. So a Tier 1
 * and a Tier 3 saving for the same printer bank the same amount each week —
 * Tier 3 just works more hours underneath it.
 *
 * Undershooting needs no special case: an approval below the funded line banks
 * nothing and the participant falls behind their own pace, which is exactly
 * what the goal tracker is for.
 *
 * Spendable coins are capped, because `approvedHours` can come from a reviewer
 * typing into a box and a fat-fingered 1000 should not mint five thousand
 * coins. Banked coins are not: they are bounded by `goal.bankedHours` already,
