 *   ask about hardware experience (will highlight appropriate funding tier
 *   when the choice shows up) / This is PCB week! If beginner: information
 *   about PCBs, else: example projects / Ask for project idea. Not sure? Pick
 *   from these options! / show tiers of funding, prompt to select (make clear
 *   this can be changed later) (if chose starter project then lock choice at
 *   tier 1) / journaling/lapse onboarding (option in corner to dismiss if
 *   you've journaled before) / exits out of first checkpoint
 *
 * It is the first of a larger per-week checkpoint system in the same note
 * (idea reel, progress reel, submission checks). Only this one is built; the
 * rest needs the feed first, since every later checkpoint is a reel.
