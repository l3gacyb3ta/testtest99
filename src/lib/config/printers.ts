/**
 * The grand-prize catalogue — the thing every banked coin is aimed at.
 *
 * Numbers come straight from the budget sheet (Half life budget – Printers),
 * and nothing here is invented on top of them. One coin is one dollar, so a
 * machine costs its shop price. Banked hours a week are the sheet's column 4:
 *
 *   banked = (shopPrice - 5 hours * 5 build weeks * $5) / 5 design weeks / $5
 *
 * Read the shape of that formula, because every projection below depends on
 * it: the season is ten weeks, and the two halves bank differently. The five
 * build weeks are the same five hours for everyone and none of them is funded,
 * so they hand every maker the same flat BUILD_WEEK_COINS whatever machine
 * they picked. Only the remainder is paced against the design weeks, and there
 * are five of those. A projection that charges the whole price to the design
 * rate asks for weeks the season does not have.
 *
 * Those banked hours are the same whatever tier you are on — the tier decides
 * how many funded hours sit underneath them, not how much you bank.
