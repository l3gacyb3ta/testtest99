/**
 * Funding tiers.
 *
 * A tier is assigned per themed project when its DESIGN phase is approved. The
 * tier's dollars are parts money, so the decision has to land before the build
 * starts, not after it.
 *
 * A tier decides ONE thing: how many of a design week's hours are spoken for by
 * the project itself. Those `fundingHours` earn dollars, not coins — they are
 * what the grant buys. Every hour above them is banked or spent.
 *
 * It decides nothing about the machine at the end of the season. That is paid
 * for out of banked coins at the same rate on every tier, and how many hours a
 * week must bank is a property of the printer someone is saving for, not of the
 * tier they are working at — see ./printers.ts. Tier 1 and Tier 3 both reach a
 * Bambu P1S; Tier 3 simply has more funded hours sitting underneath the same
 * banking.
 *
 * This is why there is no `bankHours` here any more. It used to be a tier
 * property (2/5/10), which quietly made the expensive machines unreachable from
 * Tier 1 and the cheap ones over-funded from Tier 3.
