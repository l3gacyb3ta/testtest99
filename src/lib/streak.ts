 * Journalling streaks.
 *
 * Recomputed from `WorkSession.effectiveDate` rather than incremented on write.
 * An incremented counter has to be right on every path that can create, edit,
 * back-date or soft-delete a session, and is wrong forever the first time one
 * of them is missed — there is no way to notice, and no way to repair it
 * without the recompute this module would have needed anyway. Deriving it
 * means `User.currentStreak` is a cache that any write can rebuild and
 * `scripts/` can backfill.
 *
 * The unit is the calendar day in the PROGRAM timezone, which is what
 * `effectiveDate` already stores, so a participant in Hawaii and one in Berlin
 * get the same answer for "did I journal today" as each other and as the
 * dashboard.
