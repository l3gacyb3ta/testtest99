 * The swash behind the hero's tagline and email field, and the inset the two

 *
 * It lives here rather than in `signup-form.tsx` because both ends of it are
 * needed on both sides of the client boundary: the form draws the padding, and
 * the hero has to size the box from the same number. The form is a client
 * component, so a plain function exported from it cannot be called while the
 * hero renders on the server.
 *
 * `brushstroke.png` is 2000x400 and its interior is one flat `#103070` — RGB
 * standard deviation under 1.4 across 578k opaque pixels, 52 distinct colours
 * in the whole of it — so there is no bristle texture to distort and it can be
 * stretched to the box outright. Everything the file is carrying lives in its
 * alpha: a soft rim, and two tapered ends running 12% of the width on the left
 * and 28% on the right.
 *
 * Which is what these numbers are for. Laid on the box at its own size the
 * tagline would run 2%-98% of it and put its own ends in those tapers, over
 * the painting, so the box's padding is what holds the type in the stroke's
 * solid part instead of the flat 2rem it used to need against ink.
 *
 * The horizontal inset is a share of the box, so it holds at every width; the
 * vertical one is `em` of the size the caller sets, because a percentage padding
 * resolves against the width on both axes and would be meaningless here. Their
 * two jobs are different: X clears the ends, Y clears the rim.
 *
 * Measured, at the worst pixel under the type rather than on average. At a
 * 12.5% inset the type occupies the middle 75% of the stroke's width, and
 * 1.8em holds it inside the middle 54-60% of its height at every size either
 * layout sets — a band whose lowest alpha is 0.667. The lightest thing that
 * can be behind it is bg.png's own brightest pixel across the plate's
 * footprint, `#1698a9` once the art layer's 0.66 is applied, which is 2.94:1 to
 * paper bare and 6.95:1 through the stroke. So the tagline clears 4.5:1 at any
 * size, not just at the 3:1 its 32.8 comp px would owe.
 *
 * The rounded corner went with the ink. The stroke's own alpha is 0.000 at all
 * four corners of the box, so the radius had nothing left to round.
