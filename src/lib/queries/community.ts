/**
 * The two pages that are about everyone else: Explore and the leaderboard.
 *
 * ## What is shown, and what is not
 *
 * Both are deliberately thin. A row carries a display name, an avatar, a
 * project title and numbers — never an email, a Slack id, a location or
 * anything under `encrypted*`. A leaderboard is a place where a careless
 * `select` leaks the whole user table, so these queries name every column they
 * want rather than spreading a row.
 *
 * Object keys are deliberately NOT here. R2 serves them publicly, so a key is
 * a capability to fetch that file — and the journal's photographs already ride
 * inside the body as Markdown, which is the copy this page renders. Shipping
 * the keys as well put every participant's session media into every other
 * participant's page payload for nothing.
 *
 * Journal bodies are shown as written. Participants write them knowing a
 * reviewer will read them, and the program already publishes reels to the
 * Doomscroller, so the audience is peers either way — but it is a real choice
 * and this is where it is made. Soft-deleted sessions and deleted projects are
 * excluded, so removing an entry removes it here too.
