/**
 * Everything the trail needs, read out of the database in one pass.
 *
 * ## The seam
 *
 * The platform UI derives its entire shape — how many nodes a week has, where
 * the progress reels fall, which one is live, what is locked and why — from one
 * record of checkpoint states, through `curriculum.checkpointsFor`. That
 * function is pure and already agrees with the program design, so the server's
 * only job is to say which checkpoints are done and with what, and let the
 * client derive the rest exactly as it did when the data was a toy.
 *
 * This is why the wedding is small. The alternative was a second checkpoint
 * engine on the server, and the first time the two disagreed the trail would
 * have lied to someone about work they had really done.
 *
 * ## What is NOT here
 *
 * The cinematic, the spotlight, the tab tour, and whether the Doomscroller rail
 * is open. Those are ceremony, they are per-device, and nobody else ever needs
 * to read them, so they stay in `localStorage` where a new laptop replays the
 * intro rather than inheriting a half-finished one. The server owns facts; the
 * browser owns ceremony.
