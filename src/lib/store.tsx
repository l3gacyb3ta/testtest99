/**
 * The trail's store, backed by the database.
 *
 * ## The split
 *
 * Facts come from the server, as a `StoreSnapshot` loaded once per navigation
 * by the `(app)` layout: projects, checkpoint states, coins, streak, goal.
 * Ceremony stays in `localStorage`: whether the cinematic has played, how far
 * the tab tour got, whether the Doomscroller rail is open. Nobody else ever
 * needs to read the ceremony, and a new laptop replaying the intro is a feature
 * rather than a bug.
 *
 * ## Why the derivation did not change
 *
 * Everything below `weeks` — the shape of a week, which node is live, what is
 * locked and why — is computed exactly as it was when the data was a toy, by
 * `curriculum.checkpointsFor`. The server says which checkpoints are done and
 * with what; it does not say what a week looks like. A second checkpoint engine
 * on the server would have been a second answer to "have I finished this week",
 * and the first time the two disagreed the trail would have lied to someone
 * about work they had really done.
 *
 * ## Writes
 *
 * Every mutation posts to the API and then asks Next to re-render the layout,
 * which reloads the snapshot. Each one also patches local state first, because
 * a round trip to Postgres between clicking a node and seeing it fill is long
 * enough to feel broken — and if the request fails the refresh puts the truth
 * back.
