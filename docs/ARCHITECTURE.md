# Architecture notes

Short version of the decisions that are not obvious from the code, and what
each one is defending against. Most were learned from reading
`hackclub/siege` and `hackclub/stasis`, the two sibling program platforms.

## Postgres is the source of truth; Airtable is a sink

Both siege and stasis are described as "Airtable programs" and neither uses
Airtable as its datastore. Airtable holds three things in both: the RSVP funnel,
the `YSWS Project Submission` rows the payout pipeline reads, and a few
ops-curated tables the app only reads. Everything transactional is Postgres.

That split is not incidental. Airtable has no transactions, no unique
constraints, a 5 req/s cap and 100 records per page. The review claim lock, the
credit ledger and shop purchases all need exactly the guarantees it lacks.

## The ledger reconciles to a target instead of reversing

`reconcileGrant(tx, { userId, themeProjectId, kind, target })` appends one delta
row so that `SUM(amount)` over that triple equals `target`. Approving a build
five times converges on one balance; un-approving is the same call with
`target: 0`.

Stasis instead pairs each ledger kind with a `*_REVERSED` twin and cancels by
hand, which means every aggregate over the ledger has to remember to include the
twin. Its `lib/currency.ts` carries a long comment about the query that forgot:

> Do NOT compute this by summing every DESIGN_APPROVED entry: no build approval
> ever nets out a project-less credit, so a blind sum overcounts forever and
> hides real spendable bits once the credit has been spent.

Having no reversal code path means there is no reversal code path to get wrong.
`pnpm verify:ledger` asserts the property end to end.

## Credit mutations take a per-user advisory lock

The balance is `SUM(amount)` over an append-only table, so there is no row a
transaction can lock, and Postgres's default READ COMMITTED lets two concurrent
transactions both read the same pre-existing balance and both commit. The first
version of `purchase()` relied on `@@unique([shopOrderId, kind])` and was wrong:
that constraint stops one order being charged twice, but two concurrent
purchases mint two different order ids and collide with nothing. Eight parallel
requests bought eight things with one balance.

`lockUserCredit(tx, userId)` takes a `pg_advisory_xact_lock` as the first
statement inside every transaction that reads a balance and then writes against
it — purchase, refund, admin adjustment, and the review reconcile. It releases
with the transaction, including on rollback. `scripts/verify-ledger.ts` fires
eight concurrent purchases and asserts exactly one succeeds.

## Tiers are assigned at design approval

The tier's dollars are parts money. A participant cannot buy components for a
build whose budget has not been decided, so the tier lands when the design is
approved, and the `YSWS Project Submission` row for the Design stage is the one
that carries `Requested Grant Amount`. The Build row is written at zero so the
payout team has the full trail without a second payment.

## Three hours sources, two ways to double-count

- **Journal + Hackatime are additive**, so a session whose time is already
  tracked by a linked Hackatime project must not also count as journal hours.
  `WorkSession.hoursSource = HACKATIME_TRACKED` marks those; they still exist as
  a journal entry and as evidence, but contribute zero. Stasis sums both
  unconditionally and relies on reviewers noticing.
- **Timelapse is evidence, not a bucket.** Its duration is never added to a
  total; it becomes a coverage ratio against claimed time. `coveredSeconds`
  (wall-clock time represented) is stored separately from `runtimeSeconds` (the
  video's length), because stasis stores only the runtime and then reports it as
  hours — so a 30× timelapse of eight hours displays as 0.27h and looks like the
  participant did nothing.

Approving refuses outright when Hackatime data is stale, rather than treating a
failed fetch as zero. Stasis's client returns 0 on any error including a
timeout, and that zero flows into the hours field on the grant row with no
trace: a blip during an approval silently underpays someone.

## Weeks are derived, themes are constants

Week number is `floor((now - eventStartDate) / 7) + 1`, computed in the program
timezone. There is no `Week` table: a week is not something anyone edits, and a
row would only create drift between the database and the copy on the dashboard.
Siege has run a 14-week program on exactly this.

Deadlines are **soft**. The week schedule drives what the dashboard highlights
and stamps an `onTime` flag on submissions for analytics. Nothing gates on it —
a late joiner has to be able to finish, and someone doing week 3's theme in
week 5 lands on the same row they would have in week 3. Hard gating is one
settings toggle plus per-user and per-project `submissionExtensionUntil`
columns, which stasis added after doing manual database surgery for every
extension request.

## Build may be submitted before design is approved

With five concurrent themes sharing one review queue, gating submission on
approval turns a reviewer-capacity problem into a participant-blocked problem:
someone sits idle through their build week waiting on the queue. So submission
requires only that the design has left `draft`. **Finalising** a build still
requires the design to be approved, so the ordering invariant holds where money
is involved and not where it only costs people time.

## Live switches are database rows, not env vars

Submissions open, shop open, event start date and the Airtable kill switch live
in `ProgramSettings` and are edited at `/admin/program`. Stasis put its
submission gate in `SUBMISSIONS_CLOSED` and `lib/event.ts` records the outcome:
the variable "was never flipped in Coolify and submissions silently stayed open
for two weeks". A row with a toggle and an audit trail cannot be forgotten in a
dashboard.

Tier values are the deliberate exception: they are code, because an ops person
editing a currency field at 2am must not be able to change what everyone gets
paid with no review and no record. Every review freezes the numbers it used onto
`SubmissionReview`, so changing them never rewrites history.

## Airtable writes

- `performUpsert` keyed on `(Half-Life ID, Stage)`, not read-then-write. Two
  concurrent approvals — an admin double-click, a retried request — both read
  zero rows and both create, putting duplicate grant rows into the payout sink.
- `typecast: false`, or a typo in a theme name silently adds a sixth option to
  the single-select.
- Deletion from the shared unified base goes by exact record id, captured from
  `Automation - YSWS Record ID` before the local rows are removed. Code URL is
  not unique across programs, and here all five of a participant's themed
  projects may live in one monorepo.
- One shared token bucket plus retry-with-backoff, ported from siege. Stasis has
  no rate-limit handling at all; siege's per-job `sleep 0.25` only works because
  its sync is a single serialised job.
- Failures write an `AIRTABLE_SYNC_FAILURE` audit row and are replayable from
  `/admin/program` and by the hourly retry job, because approval and the row
  reaching Airtable are separate steps and only the first one is transactional.

## RSVP is write-behind

Every RSVP lands in `RsvpBuffer` in Postgres and is drained to Airtable by a
job. Stasis writes through synchronously inside the request handler, so a
rate-limited Airtable becomes a failed signup — and only falls back to Postgres
when someone flips an env var by hand.

## Auth and guards

Hack Club Auth is one provider carrying identity, Slack ID, YSWS
`verification_status` and (optionally) address and birthday, which replaces
siege's separate Slack-OAuth-plus-identity-vault dance.

Two guard modules, because they fail differently: `lib/guards.ts` returns a JSON
response for route handlers, `lib/page-guards.ts` redirects or 404s for server
components. Page-level auth in a server component removes the auth flash and
stops an unauthorised page rendering at all — stasis does admin auth in a
`'use client'` layout, so `/admin` renders first and then vanishes.

Permission checks 404 rather than 403 where the resource's existence is itself
information, so guessing at `/admin` tells you nothing.

## Uploads store keys, not URLs

`SessionMedia.objectKey` is an R2 key; the public URL is minted at read time.
Stasis stores full URLs, so moving buckets or adding a CDN means rewriting every
row. Keys are namespaced by user id, which makes abuse traceable and orphan
cleanup possible.

Airtable attachment URLs are never handed to a browser: they are signed and
expire in about two hours. Images live in R2, and Airtable is given a URL it
fetches once.
